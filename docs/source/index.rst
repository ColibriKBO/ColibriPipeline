**ColibriPipeline** is a Python library for analyzing images from the Colibri
KBO telescope project. It is a multistage data reduction pipeline that takes
raw images from the telescope and produces lightcurves from all stars in the
field of view. It is designed to be run as near to real-time as possible.
